#modified from stackoverflow code, limited how far the algorithm looks ahead
#a single run of a power/rpm curve tends to have oscillations, where the power
#increases above the expected level for the rpm value but then drops and
#the curve intersects with itself. After this, the power/rpm returns to normal.
#we detect an intersection and assume a loop. We remove the loop.
#finally, without loops it is safe to sort based on rpm for a cleaner curve.
#With loops, sorting on rpm leads to a subtle sawtooth pattern
